# bohmwebapp
Web app that calculates quantum trajectories from the Bohmian mechanics framework
I am using this project to learn new programming languages and methods
I plan to use JS/TS to build the initial prototypes, then eventually transfer the main calculations to C++/Rust
I am also interested in learning how to use local/cloud databases and query simulation results with SQL
